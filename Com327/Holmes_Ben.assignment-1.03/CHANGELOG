    I fixed the errors I was getting with the non tunneling distance display, but I still have an error with displaying the Player Character position.

    I finished most of Assignment 3 for 327. I still have all the tunneling distances displaying, and started creating the methods to display the non tunneling monsters. Right now my program is grabbing all rock, displaying a 0, grabbing the PC, displaying 0, and grabbing all rooms or corridors and displaying a Z. Just need to update the rooms and corridors to display the correct distances.

I created functions for handling Tunneling distance. I also found a priority queue, and implemented it. I created a priority object which stores distances, and a function to find neighbors of each item on the priority queue.

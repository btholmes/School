This is Assignment 1.03 for COM 327. It calculates distances for Tunneling and non Tunneling monsters, while also choosing a starting locations for the PC character. Distances are calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue, and are displayed on a map of numbers, and letters, representing the distances. Three maps will be displayed, one with the PC position, 1 with Tunneling distance, and 1 with non tunneling distance.

	Started the assignment. Converted all files to cpp, and fixed all errors. Haven't started on the rest of the assignment yet.

	I tried creating classes for Monster and dice, and using the header files, but I keep getting all these erros saying swap macro requires three arguments but only two give. I have no idea what it is, but when I just create the monster and dice class insdie the rlg327.cpp file, it works fine, so that's what I'm doing.

	I have the monster and dice classes recreated, including all the getter and setter methods. Now I am starting on parsing the text file. I created a monster_desc file, and put it in my home directory, under the .rlg327 folder.
	I can do basic parsing, read the file, and print it to the console, but I don't have the specifics worked out.

	I worked on parsing the monsters all day. I managed to get it working. I created global vectors for the monsters, and their relative colors. So after a monster is parsed, I put it in the vector. I use the get line method to read through the file.

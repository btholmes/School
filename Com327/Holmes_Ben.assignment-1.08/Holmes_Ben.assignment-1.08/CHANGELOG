	-Today I spent a lot of time reading the pdf. Then I tried implementing the new classes, only I kept getting a seg fault, and couldn't find the solution. After about 3 hours of looking, I decided to start the project over, and compile after every change so I could find the source of the seg fault. 
	- I found I was accessing an undefined variable in my monster class, so I changed that and was finally able to get my monsters to display with color.

	-Today I created the Object.h and Object.cpp files for creating object instances from the object_description model. I was really confused for a while until I realized Shaeffer spelled defense with a c in his code. Another error I kept getting was undefined reference to one of my Object classes. I learned I needed to add the Object.o to my make file, and after that it compiled fine. I finished the layout for most of the Object class, but it still isn't implemented.

	-I finally finished the assignment. I had to add in an objectMap to my dungeon.h file, to keep track of which objects have been seen, similar to the character map. Then I also added a couple lines in character.cpp under the can_see function. Each time the pc_learn_terrain function was called, I checked to see if there was an object in the terrain. If there was, I changed a variable in the object called isVisible to 1, indicating that it should be displayed. Then in io.cpp I added an else if clause to check for objects in the object map which have been seen, and if they have, I display them.

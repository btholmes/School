    I just finished the assignment, right in time also. I finsihed implementing the loadSave method, I was having an error because I wasn't storing the rock hardness on each load, so when I tried to load and save, it messed a lot up.

    I made a lot of changes, got the load and save methods to work. I'm working on getting them to work simultaneously. One thing I realized is when you call load and save, it could involve saving a dungeon with more rooms than I permit in my code. For instance if the dungeon had ike 100 rooms my load save calls together would fail. I decided to create a separate method called loadSave().

     I took my old code, implemented hardness, and included it in my new Assignment 1_02 project. Unfortunately I'm still new to C, so this assignment code might look messy, but I'm planning to implement headers in the next assignment.

    I basically finished the loadDungeon method, and made it print to the console. There is one problem, right now my dungeon is just a 2D array of char, but I need to change it so it will be a 2D array of room structures(I think). I made a lot of progress today though, might keep working on it.

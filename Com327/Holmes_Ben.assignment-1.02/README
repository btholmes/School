This is my implementation of Assignment1_02. It successfully loads, saves, or loads and saves a dungeon simultaneousl. To run, it requires either a --load or --save argument. If none is included, it will ask for one. Since nothing was specified regarding random generation in the pdf, I implemented it as follows. When you supply --save, it will generate a random dungeon, display it, and then save it to the dungeon file. When you run --load, it loads the saved file from dungeon, and when you supply --load and --save, it loads the currently saved dungeon, displays it, and resaves it.
